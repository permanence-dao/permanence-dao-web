                        Permanence DAO allocates a share of its voting power to its community, which consists of ID-verified nominators of its validators.<br>
                        <br>
                        To illustrate this voting model, we can consider a 54%-46% voting allocation. When the target number of community members is reached, 54% of the total voting power will be allocated to the members. Each of the nine members has equal voting power, contributing 6% each. The remaining 46% of the voting power is reserved for the community votes. As explained in the previous section, community members are ID-verified nominators of the Permanence DAO validators.<br>

                        Following the same example, community vote allocation starts at 0% when there are no community members, and converges to 46% as the number of community members (i.e. ID-verified nominators) approaches the target, which is to be determined through member discussions and forecast calculations.<br>

                        </p>
                        The voting model is an area of ongoing research and experimentation for the DAO, and the changes to the mechanisms and vote allocations will be discussed diligently and shared with the community in a transparent manner.
